# IT park Elevator Manager

Ascendas is an iT park that's always full of rush. It has multiple buildings. Each building with lots of floors. And it's not easy to use stairs to get to different floors. So, primarily people try to get to different floors using elevators. Currently people click on the elevator button and wait for a long time for the elevator to come. Ascendas organization has decided to bring in a new system to manage the elevator so that the waiting time for the people is as little as possible.

You need to write a software that intelligently allocates elevator to wait at appropriate floors when people click buttons at each floor. The intelligence is based on some rules. This kind of artificial intelligence system is called rule based system or expert system.

Input is person clicking button in a floor.
Output is elevator waiting at floor for person to get in and get out. Also, it should appropriately wait at floors and not wait at any floor when the elevator is full. More rules -

Even with two separate programs, how to give input and show output and check output, gotta see
