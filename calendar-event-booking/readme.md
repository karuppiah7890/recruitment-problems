# Calendar Event Booking

Given the calendar data of N people, where the data tells you if a person is
busy at what time slot, find time slot for a meeting for a given duration and
within the work hour timings. 

The data is given for a day. 

If no time slot can be found for the meeting, which can accommodate everyone's
calendar, give that as result.

Extension - find a time slot where we can accommodate the most number of people
of not all. The minimum number of people needs to be more than max(2, N/2)
